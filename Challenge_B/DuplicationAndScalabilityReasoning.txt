My design avoids duplication due to normalising it into its third normal form. Separating references into their own independent tables reduces the need to replicate data, for example: In the MachineMovements Table there is foreign keys linking to the machines table, bay table and employees table, this prevents duplication as there will only be one record corresponding to the ID. If the employee name was stored in the MachineMovements Table then if you want to change his name you would have to change all the records with his name in it, with this design the employees name is only one row, with no duplication. It is scalable due to its current structure making it faster for the database to search, index, and join tables using the primary and foreign keys. Its design with multiple tables also makes it easier to make changes to a specific table without needing to make big changes.
